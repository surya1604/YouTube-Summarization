Are you ready for the first strategy? OK, here it comes. First strategy - It's not about me. What do you mean it's not about me? This sounds weird, doesn't it? Because when I take things personally,\n",

            "kicking and screaming \"I hate you!\" Do you take that personally? No! No, you don't because you know \n",
            "this is not about me. It's about what he wants, what he needs. He's angry because he just wants\n",
            "to stay up a bit longer, that's all. So the first strategy \n",
            "to not take it personally is it's not about me. Look at the other person's intention. When a driver is tailgating\n",
            "and flashing his lights, he probably does it\n",
            "because he's in a hurry. It's not about me, you see? It's as simple as that. In theory. Because in real life,\n",

            "ladies and gentlemen, how many thoughts \n",
            "our brain produces a day? 50,000! And guess how many of them are positive? Only 10,000. So this means that 80% of what we think\n",
            "are negative thoughts. That's a lot, isn't it? When you see two colleagues\n",
            "talking to each other, and just then, they look at you\n",
            "and they start laughing, do you think, \"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes\n",
            "and they want them too\"? No! Or do you think, \"Darn, they're laughing at me. They are gossiping about me.\" So it takes a lot of effort \n",
            "to correct yourself and say, \"Hang on. I have no clue! They might be laughing about something\n",
            "that has nothing to do with me.\" So seeing the positive intention\n",
            "of the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that's why I became a referee: to train my brain\n",
            "not to take things personally. I train my brain\n",
            "an hour and a half a week, the entire period of a match. I say this for the football dummies. Now, before the match, I'm warming up. Not only physically, but also mentally. I give myself some pep talk\n",
            "in the dressing room: \"Frederik, watch out. Lots of things will trigger you\n",
            "during the game. You're going to make decisions\n",
            "who some will not agree with and they will shout\n",

            "of the other person, there's no need to take it personally. When I apply this strategy\n",
            "very consciously, I admit it, I feel much more \n",
            "at ease on the field. When the coach,\n",
            "the players or the spectators do not agree with my decisions, I'm less easily thrown off balance. This strategy, \n",
            "ladies and gentlemen, works! But not always, unfortunately. Because some words they shout at me,\n",
            "like here, do really hit a raw nerve: \"You're a loser. Choose another hobby! You know what? Go fishing!\" Ouch! Maybe they are right. Perhaps I took the wrong decision. Maybe I am a loser. Honestly, that's how I feel sometimes. Do you see this? Every coin has a flip side. When this first strategy -\n",
            "it's not about me - doesn't work, it simply means \"It is about me!\" [It is about me.] I have to look in the mirror\n",
            "and question myself. As a beginning referee,\n",
            "I still feel insecure. Especially me. I never played soccer. It is about me because it has something to do\n",
            "with my insecurity, I doubt about myself. Or a part of myself\n",

            "that clumsy part of myself. Why else would I \n",
            "take it personally, right? When I say, \"Ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "you are an orange,\" who would take this personally? No one, right? Why not? Because nothing in you believes\n",
            "that you are in fact an orange. An orange? Unless, of course, that you're a ginger\n",
            "and you feel bad because of that. Which is luckily not the case with me. But - but when someone says,\n",
            "\"Frederik, you are so selfish.\" Ouch! I do take it personally. And it only happens because I know\n",
            "there is some truth in it. If I'm honest, I'm aware of the fact that I do not always\n",
            "take into account other people's needs. When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this\n",

            "to give yourself some empathy. Ooh, this hurts. Darn! I'm longing so hard for recognition, and I feel sad if I don't get it. You see? And you can also - why not? - speak up. Just tell the other one\n",

            "to stay up a bit longer, that's all. So the first strategy \n",
            "to not take it personally is it's not about me. Look at the other person's intention. When a driver is tailgating\n",
            "and flashing his lights, he probably does it\n",

            "ladies and gentlemen, how many thoughts \n",
            "our brain produces a day? 50,000! And guess how many of them are positive? Only 10,000. So this means that 80% of what we think\n",
            "are negative thoughts. That's a lot, isn't it? When you see two colleagues\n",
            "talking to each other, and just then, they look at you\n",
            "and they start laughing, do you think, \"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes\n",
            "and they want them too\"? No! Or do you think, \"Darn, they're laughing at me. They are gossiping about me.\" So it takes a lot of effort \n",
            "to correct yourself and say, \"Hang on. I have no clue! They might be laughing about something\n",
            "that has nothing to do with me.\" So seeing the positive intention\n",
            "of the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that's why I became a referee: to train my brain\n",
            "not to take things personally. I train my brain\n",
            "an hour and a half a week, the entire period of a match. I say this for the football dummies. Now, before the match, I'm warming up. Not only physically, but also mentally. I give myself some pep talk\n",
            "in the dressing room: \"Frederik, watch out. Lots of things will trigger you\n",

            "who some will not agree with and they will shout\n",
            "unpleasant things at you.\" So I tell myself, \"Frederik, don't take it personally. It's not about me. They just want to be right. They simply want their team to win.\" You see? When I focus on the intention\n",
            "of the other person, there's no need to take it personally. When I apply this strategy\n",
            "very consciously, I admit it, I feel much more \n",
            "at ease on the field. When the coach,\n",
            "the players or the spectators do not agree with my decisions, I'm less easily thrown off balance. This strategy, \n",
            "ladies and gentlemen, works! But not always, unfortunately. Because some words they shout at me,\n",
            "like here, do really hit a raw nerve: \"You're a loser. Choose another hobby! You know what? Go fishing!\" Ouch! Maybe they are right. Perhaps I took the wrong decision. Maybe I am a loser. Honestly, that's how I feel sometimes. Do you see this? Every coin has a flip side. When this first strategy -\n",

            "and question myself. As a beginning referee,\n",

            "take it personally, right? When I say, \"Ladies and gentlemen,\n",

            "that you are in fact an orange. An orange? Unless, of course, that you're a ginger\n",
            "and you feel bad because of that. Which is luckily not the case with me. But - but when someone says,\n",
            "\"Frederik, you are so selfish.\" Ouch! I do take it personally. And it only happens because I know\n",
            "there is some truth in it. If I'm honest, I'm aware of the fact that I do not always\n",
            "take into account other people's needs. When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this\n",
            "is rooted in your childhood. Maybe as a child\n",
            "you were never good enough. When you came home with a 9 out of 10, they said, \"Hey, and why not a 10?\" You see? We can only take things personally\n",

            "to give yourself some empathy. Ooh, this hurts. Darn! I'm longing so hard for recognition, and I feel sad if I don't get it. You see? And you can also - why not? - speak up. Just tell the other one\n",
            "what's going on inside you. \"Hey, I'm in the middle of my story here, and you just walk away\n",

            "without blaming the other one, you increase the chance\n",
            "that the other one will understand you and take your needs into account. Do you see what I mean? To conclude - how not to take things personally. One - it is not about me! Look at the other person's intention. If that doesn't work: two - it is about me. Give yourself empathy and speak up. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please,\n",

            "Summary:\n",
            "  Hey guys, I would like to see fair play on the field, respect and positivity. One year ago, I decided I wanted to become a football referee. because I wanted to learn how not to take things personally. [How not to take things personally?] You are probably thinking, \"Being a referee is the perfect environment to learn how not to take  things personally, isn't it?\" As a referee, I am the scapegoat. Apparently, I'm always wrong. And I wanted to learn  how not to take all this personally. For example, when I drive slowly because I'm trying to find a specific location and somebody is just driving behind me, I feel hunted. Especially when they start honking  and flashing their headlights, I take it personally. Do you see what I mean? Or when somebody cancels  an appointment last minute, I get the feeling that I'm not important enough. Again, I take it personally. I give keynote speeches, and I really like it as long as I can draw  my audience into my story. Because the very moment  I see somebody is not paying attention - for example, when somebody is looking at his smartphone - (snap) it just happens: I take it personally. Feel free to take your smartphones, and you can even start talking  to your neighbor. I will not take it personally. Because now, here and now, I'm very conscious that this can happen. So tonight, I would like to share this strategy with you. Because, I guess, I'm not  the only person in this room who sometimes takes things personally, right? Imagine - imagine you invite a friend to go to the movies, and she replies, \"Oh, sorry, I have to work.\" So you come home, and you would like to wind down and share this terrible experience. But while you're telling your story, the other one walks away  to switch on the TV. Do you want to be right? [Do you want to be right?] Wouldn't it be so much easier  to not take things personally? So the question is do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? I know what some of you are thinking: \"I will make sure I will be happy by being right.\" How to become happy by not taking things personally? You are standing at the kickoff of the match of your life, the match by which you will learn how to stop taking things personally. So as a referee, I brought my coin for the toss. And they stand for two strategies, two strategies to no longer taking things personally. First strategy - It's not about me. What do you mean it's not about me? Because when I take things personally, I'm convinced it is about me. When I see someone is looking at his phone, I feel offended. I think, \"Hey, I've put so much effort and time in this presentation. But in fact, it isn't about me. What if I try to look at it from the other person's perspective, asking myself, \"Why? Or, on the contrary, he finds it very interesting and he wants to take notes on his smartphone. I simply need to shift my focus from \"me\" to \"we,\" and I won't take it personally. If I try to see the intention of the other one, I make space for understanding instead of irritation. When you put your son to bed but he doesn't want to, he throws himself on the floor, kicking and screaming \"I hate you!\" No, you don't because you know  this is not about me. So the first strategy  to not take it personally is it's not about me. Look at the other person's intention. It's not about me, you see? Because in real life, it turns out to be a hell of a job. Do you have any idea,  ladies and gentlemen, how many thoughts  our brain produces a day? That's a lot, isn't it? When you see two colleagues talking to each other, and just then, they look at you and they start laughing, do you think, \"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes and they want them too\"? So seeing the positive intention of the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that's why I became a referee: to train my brain not to take things personally. Now, before the match, I'm warming up. So I tell myself, \"Frederik, don't take it personally. It's not about me. When I focus on the intention of the other person, there's no need to take it personally. When I apply this strategy very consciously, I admit it, I feel much more  at ease on the field. When the coach, the players or the spectators do not agree with my decisions, I'm less easily thrown off balance. When this first strategy - it's not about me - doesn't work, it simply means \"It is about me!\" As a beginning referee, I still feel insecure. It is about me because it has something to do with my insecurity, I doubt about myself. Do you see my point, ladies and gentlemen? Even if I know that a driver is only tailgating because he's in a hurry, I still take it personally when he honks or he's flashing his headlights. When I say, \"Ladies and gentlemen, you are an orange,\" who would take this personally? If I'm honest, I'm aware of the fact that I do not always take into account other people's needs. When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this is rooted in your childhood. When you came home with a 9 out of 10, they said, \"Hey, and why not a 10?\" We can only take things personally if it somehow touches a raw nerve. I'm longing so hard for recognition, and I feel sad if I don't get it. \"Hey, I'm in the middle of my story here, and you just walk away to switch on the TV? By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one, you increase the chance that the other one will understand you and take your needs into account. Do you see what I mean? To conclude - how not to take things personally. One - it is not about me! Look at the other person's intention. If that doesn't work: two - it is about me. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please, do not take it personally, but I really do hope that you will take a couple of things personally within the next hours and days. And as a referee, I even earn some money by it. Who doesn't like 20 euros to learn how not to take things personally? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now?\n"

            "Summary:\n",
            " Hey guys, I would like to see fair play on the field, respect and positivity. One year ago, I decided I wanted to become a football referee. because I wanted to learn how not to take things personally. [How not to take things personally?] You are probably thinking, \"Being a referee is the perfect environment to learn how not to take  things personally, isn't it?\" As a referee, I am the scapegoat. And I wanted to learn  how not to take all this personally. For example, when I drive slowly because I'm trying to find a specific location and somebody is just driving behind me, I feel hunted. Especially when they start honking  and flashing their headlights, I take it personally. Do you see what I mean? Or when somebody cancels  an appointment last minute, I get the feeling that I'm not important enough. Again, I take it personally. Because the very moment  I see somebody is not paying attention - for example, when somebody is looking at his smartphone - (snap) it just happens: I take it personally. Because now, here and now, I'm very conscious that this can happen. So tonight, I would like to share this strategy with you. Because, I guess, I'm not  the only person in this room who sometimes takes things personally, right? Imagine - imagine you invite a friend to go to the movies, and she replies, \"Oh, sorry, I have to work.\" But while you're telling your story, the other one walks away  to switch on the TV. Wouldn't it be so much easier  to not take things personally? So the question is do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? You are standing at the kickoff of the match of your life, the match by which you will learn how to stop taking things personally. So as a referee, I brought my coin for the toss. First strategy - It's not about me. What do you mean it's not about me? Because when I take things personally, I'm convinced it is about me. When I see someone is looking at his phone, I feel offended. I think, \"Hey, I've put so much effort and time in this presentation. But in fact, it isn't about me. What if I try to look at it from the other person's perspective, asking myself, \"Why? I simply need to shift my focus from \"me\" to \"we,\" and I won't take it personally. If I try to see the intention of the other one, I make space for understanding instead of irritation. When you put your son to bed but he doesn't want to, he throws himself on the floor, kicking and screaming \"I hate you!\" No, you don't because you know  this is not about me. So the first strategy  to not take it personally is it's not about me. Look at the other person's intention. It's not about me, you see? Because in real life, it turns out to be a hell of a job. That's a lot, isn't it? When you see two colleagues talking to each other, and just then, they look at you and they start laughing, do you think, \"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes and they want them too\"? So seeing the positive intention of the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that's why I became a referee: to train my brain not to take things personally. When I focus on the intention of the other person, there's no need to take it personally. When I apply this strategy very consciously, I admit it, I feel much more  at ease on the field. When the coach, the players or the spectators do not agree with my decisions, I'm less easily thrown off balance. When this first strategy - it's not about me - doesn't work, it simply means \"It is about me!\" As a beginning referee, I still feel insecure. It is about me because it has something to do with my insecurity, I doubt about myself. Do you see my point, ladies and gentlemen? Even if I know that a driver is only tailgating because he's in a hurry, I still take it personally when he honks or he's flashing his headlights. When I say, \"Ladies and gentlemen, you are an orange,\" who would take this personally? If I'm honest, I'm aware of the fact that I do not always take into account other people's needs. We can only take things personally if it somehow touches a raw nerve. \"Hey, I'm in the middle of my story here, and you just walk away to switch on the TV? By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one, you increase the chance that the other one will understand you and take your needs into account. Do you see what I mean? To conclude - how not to take things personally. One - it is not about me! Look at the other person's intention. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please, do not take it personally, but I really do hope that you will take a couple of things personally within the next hours and days. And as a referee, I even earn some money by it. Who doesn't like 20 euros to learn how not to take things personally? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now?\n"

            "are negative thoughts. That's a lot, isn't it? When you see two colleagues\n",
            "talking to each other, and just then, they look at you\n",
            "and they start laughing, do you think, \"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes\n",
            "and they want them too\"? No! Or do you think, \"Darn, they're laughing at me. They are gossiping about me.\" So it takes a lot of effort \n",
            "to correct yourself and say, \"Hang on. I have no clue! They might be laughing about something\n",
            "that has nothing to do with me.\" So seeing the positive intention\n",
            "of the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that's why I became a referee: to train my brain\n",

            "an hour and a half a week, the entire period of a match. I say this for the football dummies. Now, before the match, I'm warming up. Not only physically, but also mentally. I give myself some pep talk\n",
            "in the dressing room: \"Frederik, watch out. Lots of things will trigger you\n",

            "who some will not agree with and they will shout\n",
            "unpleasant things at you.\" So I tell myself, \"Frederik, don't take it personally. It's not about me. They just want to be right. They simply want their team to win.\" You see? When I focus on the intention\n",

            "like here, do really hit a raw nerve: \"You're a loser. Choose another hobby! You know what? Go fishing!\" Ouch! Maybe they are right. Perhaps I took the wrong decision. Maybe I am a loser. Honestly, that's how I feel sometimes. Do you see this? Every coin has a flip side. When this first strategy -\n",

            "I still feel insecure. Especially me. I never played soccer. It is about me because it has something to do\n",
            "with my insecurity, I doubt about myself. Or a part of myself\n",
            "that I haven't come to terms with. Do you see my point, ladies and gentlemen? Even if I know that a driver is only tailgating\n",
            "because he's in a hurry, I still take it personally when he honks\n",
            "or he's flashing his headlights. So I must question myself. Probably I was driving too slowly. I'm aware of it. I just don't like\n",

            "take it personally, right? When I say, \"Ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "you are an orange,\" who would take this personally? No one, right? Why not? Because nothing in you believes\n",

            "to give yourself some empathy. Ooh, this hurts. Darn! I'm longing so hard for recognition, and I feel sad if I don't get it. You see? And you can also - why not? - speak up. Just tell the other one\n",
            "what's going on inside you. \"Hey, I'm in the middle of my story here, and you just walk away\n",

Look at the other person's intention. If that doesn't work: two - it is about me. Give yourself empathy and speak up. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please,\n",

            " I only get paid 20 euros per match. because I wanted to learn how not to take things personally. [How not to take things personally?] You are probably thinking, \"Being a referee is the perfect environment to learn how not to take  things personally, isn't it?\" Because, I guess, I'm not  the only person in this room who sometimes takes things personally, right? Why do we take things personally? Wouldn't it be so much easier  to not take things personally? How to become happy by not taking things personally? You are standing at the kickoff of the match of your life, the match by which you will learn how to stop taking things personally. And they stand for two strategies, two strategies to no longer taking things personally. Because when I take things personally, I'm convinced it is about me. And that's why I became a referee: to train my brain not to take things personally. When this first strategy - it's not about me - doesn't work, it simply means \"It is about me!\" We can only take things personally if it somehow touches a raw nerve. To conclude - how not to take things personally. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please, do not take it personally, but I really do hope that you will take a couple of things personally within the next hours and days. Who doesn't like 20 euros to learn how not to take things personally? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Why do you still want these 20 euros? (Audience member) Because it's still 20 euros!\n"
